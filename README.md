# Week 8 - RESTful APIs

## Description:
RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform four operations termed as CRUD (C: create, R: read, U: update, and D: delete). Create and/or update is used to post data, get for reading/listing data, and delete to remove data. This project was created to demonstrate how APIs work to send, handling user's request.
